# LearningLog

This is a collection of all the resources I have been using to learn programming outside of college. I will mainly be focusing on rebuilding my foundation of front-end languages
and then I will move onto backend languages as well. This learning log was inspired by Syknapse's Learning Tracker Repo, which
can be found here : https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker-first-ten-months
